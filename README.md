## About
Our assignment was to create a website that allowed a user to randomly view motivational posters, save the poster, and also have the ability to create their own poster.

## Setup
* Fork and clone down this repo
* Change into the hang-in-there-boilerplate directory
* Make any edits to the files to make the site your own

## Project Goals
* Write clean, DRY JavaScript to store our data
* Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
* Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
* Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements
* Begin to understand how to write effective, clean HTML & CSS
* Use git collaboratively to complete the project (pull requests, merging, and code reviews);

## Technologies Used
* HTML & CSS
* Javascript
